DATA QUALITY NOTES:
- SPI data was cleaned to remove fill values (-9999) and extreme outliers
- Problematic equatorial boundary cells were removed
- SPI values were capped at ±4 for realistic drought/wet conditions
- This cleaning was necessary due to data quality issues in the original dataset

No missing zonal statistics detected.

SPI INTERPRETATION:
SPI >= 2.0:  Extremely wet conditions
1.5 <= SPI < 2.0: Severely wet conditions
1.0 <= SPI < 1.5: Moderately wet conditions
0.5 <= SPI < 1.0: Mildly wet conditions
-0.5 < SPI < 0.5: Normal conditions
-1.0 < SPI <= -0.5: Mildly dry conditions
-1.5 < SPI <= -1.0: Moderately dry conditions
-2.0 < SPI <= -1.5: Severely dry conditions
SPI <= -2.0: Extremely dry conditions
